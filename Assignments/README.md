# **Python Class Exercises Repository**

This repository contains the Python exercises I completed during the Arewa data science 30 days in python challenge, using Jupyter notebooks within Visual Studio Code.

## **Overview**

The repository is a comprehensive collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) that explore essential topics in Python. It serves as a resource for anyone starting their Python journey or revisiting core concepts through hands-on examples and clear explanations.

## **Features**

The exercises cover the following topics:

1. **Variables**:  
   - Basics of variable declarations and data types.  
   - Examples include integers, floats, strings, and booleans.  

2. **Operators**:  
   - Arithmetic, logical, comparison, and assignment operators.  
   - Illustrated with practical examples for better understanding.  

3. **Strings**:  
   - String slicing, concatenation, and formatting techniques.  
   - Methods such as `.replace()`, `.split()`, and `.strip()`.  

4. **Lists**:  
   - Creating and modifying lists, indexing, and slicing.  
   - Using methods like `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `.sort()`.  

5. **Tuples**:  
   - Understanding immutable sequences.  
   - Tuple operations and unpacking examples.  

6. **Sets**:  
   - Unique properties of sets and their operations.  
   - Examples include union, intersection, and difference.  

7. **Dictionaries**:  
   - Key-value pairs, adding/modifying elements.  
   - Useful methods like `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()`.  

8. **Conditionals**:  
   - Implementing decision-making using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.  
   - Practical examples and nested conditionals.  

9. **Loops**:  
   - Iteration with `for` and `while` loops.  
   - Breaking, continuing, and skipping iterations.  

10. **Functions and List Comprehensions**:  
    - Writing reusable functions, lambda expressions, and default arguments.  
    - Using list comprehensions for concise and efficient operations.  

## **Repository Structure**

Each topic is organized into a separate Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) for ease of navigation and understanding.
